```

## Description 

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Installation 
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Esztergb/social-network-api

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install dependencies directly from the command line).

   Commands to install each dependency:

   - Command for express will be npm i express@4.18.2
   - Command for mongoose will be npm i mongoose
   - Command for nodemon will be npm i nodemon
   
6. Next, you will want to make sure you have access to a MongoDB account and MongoDB Compass, these will allow you to interact with the database and visually confirm what changes are being made in the database. 

7. Once all dependencies are installed, you will then be able to run the command npm start from the root directory to spin up the server. With nodemon installed, you will also be able to utilize the command npm run dev to keep the server spun up between code edits.

8. From there, you can utilize applications such as Insomnia to test the functionality of the API routes within the program and make edits to the code base (Link to install Insomnia -> https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/install).

##  Credits
The general structuring of routes and file organization was based on mini project and some other modules from bootcamp. I worked with a tutor, Drew Sanches who also helped me finalize my project.
